CodeBase is a fast database engine for C and C++ programmers. 
CodeBase comes with it's own report engine, which allows 
distribution, in which the user can create their own reports. 
CodeBase is portable across all major platforms. Bit optimization - 
Query Technology allows you to query a 500,000 record data file in 
less than a second. The Codebase library comes with pre-compiled DLL 
and full source code. CodeBase is a C library for database 
management. Its compat- ibility allows you to directly create, 
access, or change dBASE IV, dBASE III, FoxPro or Clipper data, index, 
or memo files. CodeBase has full multi-user capabilities. When 
programs are run on a network, the network is automatically detected 
and used. CodeBase allows both explicit and automatic record locking 
and file locking. It is also possible to bypass the locking mechanism 
and read data locked by another user.  All of the CodeBase functions 
work together to allow C program ers to program at a very high level. 
Programs will execute very quickly, they will be readable and there 
will be no unnecessary lines of code.  NOTE: DOS, plus Windows DLLs. 
Included Projectfiles for most compilers. C++, C, Pascal and Basic.
