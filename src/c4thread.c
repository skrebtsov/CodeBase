   In case of error, this function ignores the error and continues on.  It
     does not set error4code( CODE4 ).  This is because the connection may already
     be invalid at this point, and thus expected connection errors may occur
     which we just want to ignore.

   NOTES

   This function is called by the application/server in order to signal to the
     communications thread that a connection no longer needs servicing.

   After making the request, it waits for the request to be completed by
     waiting on the CONNECT4THREAD.completedSemaphore semaphore

   This routine does the following:
     inter4completeRequested( connectThread->inter, connectThread )
     WaitForSingleObject( connectThread->completedSemaphore )

/* PARAMATERS

   connectThread is the CONNECT4THREAD to initialize
   connect is a possibly 0 input CONNECT4.  If null, it means that this
     connection is a special connection and does not need to have the
     communications thread assign a worker thread to it when data comes in.
   connectLow is a required pointer to a valid low-level connection
   startWorkState is used to specify a work state for the connect.  If the
     connect is special-service ( eg. blasting ), this should
     be set to CONNECT4SPECIAL.  Otherwise it should be set to 0.

   ERRORS

   If failure, call error4() to set CodeBase error code, and return error
     back to caller.  De-initialize anything which was initialized in case
     of error before returning to caller.
